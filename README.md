# Swarm 
Swarm is a Go-based load testing tool designed to simplify performance testing for developers and engineers. Our primary goal is to reduce the learning curve typically associated with load testing tools by providing YAML configuration support and an intuitive command-line interface.

### objective
1. CLI implementation
2. YAML configuration support
3. Multi path load testing

## Input/Output
